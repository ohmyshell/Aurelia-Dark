## Customization

### Changing Color Palette

Want to use a different color scheme? Aurelia Dark makes it easy!

#### Manual Color Editing

Edit colors directly in `colors.toml`:

```bash
nano ~/.config/omarchy/themes/aurelia-dark/colors.toml
```

Key colors to customize:

```toml
accent = "#F05629"          # Primary accent (buttons, highlights)
background = "#181B25"      # Main background color
foreground = "#E1E4EA"      # Text/foreground color
cursor = "#F05629"          # Cursor color

# ANSI terminal colors (color0-color15)
color1 = "#E8778A"          # Red
color2 = "#72C9A0"          # Green
color3 = "#F5936A"          # Yellow
color4 = "#7EB8FA"          # Blue
# ... and more
```

#### How Colors Cascade Through the Theme

The colors in `colors.toml` are used as the base for:

- **Terminal emulators** — Alacritty, Kitty, Ghostty
- **Launcher** — Walker (accent highlights)
- **Taskbar** — Waybar buttons and backgrounds
- **GTK applications** — File manager, Settings, etc.
- **Notifications** — Mako notification daemon
- **Lockscreen** — Hyprlock
- **TUI apps** — Neovim, btop, FZF, etc.

Changing the main colors in `colors.toml` propagates to all these components!

#### Applying Your Custom Palette

After changing colors, re-apply the theme:

1. Open Walker: `SUPER + ALT + SPACE`
2. Go to: **Install → Style → Theme**
3. Select **Aurelia Dark** and apply
4. All apps reload with your new palette!

### Changing Icon Pack

The theme comes with **Yaru-red-dark** icons, but you can use any icon pack.

#### Recommended Modern Icon Packs

- **Papirus-Dark** — Clean, modern, highly polished
- **Tela** — Contemporary design with excellent coverage
- **Fluent** — Windows Fluent Design style

#### Installing Alternative Icon Packs

```bash
# Install Papirus (recommended)
yay -S papirus-icon-theme

# Or Tela
yay -S tela-icon-theme

# Or Fluent
yay -S fluent-icon-theme
```

#### Changing the Icon Pack

Edit the theme's icon configuration:

```bash
nano ~/.config/omarchy/themes/aurelia-dark/icons.theme
```

Change to your preferred pack:

```
# Default (Yaru-red-dark)
Yaru-red-dark

# Alternative options:
Papirus-Dark
Tela-circle
Fluent
```

Then re-apply the theme to activate the new icons.

#### Using Omarchy's Icon Menu

You can also change icons through Walker:

1. Open Walker: `SUPER + ALT + SPACE`
2. Go to: **Install → Style → Icons**
3. Choose your preferred icon pack
4. Apply

## Troubleshooting

### Wallpapers not showing in Style > Background menu

The wallpapers should appear automatically after installation. If they don't:

1. Verify the backgrounds are present in the theme directory:
   ```bash
   ls ~/.config/omarchy/current/theme/backgrounds/
   ```

2. If empty, re-apply the theme to copy them:
   ```bash
   omarchy-theme-set aurelia-dark
   ```

3. Refresh Walker or restart it with `pkill -f walker`

### Theme files not being applied

If components like Waybar or Walker aren't showing the theme colors:

1. Verify the theme is active:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.config/omarchy/current/theme.name
   ```
   Should output: `aurelia-dark`

2. Re-apply the theme:
   ```bash
   omarchy-theme-set aurelia-dark
   ```

3. Restart the affected application
